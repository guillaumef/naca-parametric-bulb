# naca-parametric-bulb
Naca parametric bulb with Openscad.
Perfect for 3d printed (lead casting) rc sailboat bulb.

Manage:
* asymetric NACA profile !
* complex form for the third dimension.
* beaver tail


How-to:
* Choose or add new airfoil .dat file in airfoils directory
* Configure the bulb.scad and generate your parametric bulb.


To reach the right weight:
* generate the STL file
* check the volume in cm3
* compute your material volume to weight (i.e. lead weight grams per cubic cm: 11.342)
* fine tune the scale factor or the form
